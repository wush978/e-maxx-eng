<!--?title Pick's Theorem -->
<h1 id="picks-theorem">Pick's Theorem</h1>
<p>A polygon without self-intersections is called lattice if all its vertices have integer coordinates in some 2D grid. Pick's theorem provides a way to compute the area of this polygon through the number of vertices that are lying on the boundary and the number of vertices that lie strictly inside the polygon.</p>
<h2 id="formula">Formula</h2>
<p>Given a certain lattice polygon with non-zero area.</p>
<p>We denote its area by <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span>, the number of points with integer coordinates lying strictly inside the polygon by <span class="math inline"><em>I</em></span> and the number of points lying on polygon sides by <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>.</p>
<p>Then, the <strong>Pick's formula</strong> states:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$S=I+\frac{B}{2}-1$$</span><br /></p>
<p>In particular, if the values of <span class="math inline"><em>I</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> for a polygon are given, the area can be calculated in <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(1)</span> without even knowing the vertices.</p>
<p>This formula was discovered and proven by Austrian mathematician Georg Alexander Pick in 1899.</p>
<h2 id="proof">Proof</h2>
<p>The proof is carried out in many stages: from simple polygons to arbitrary ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A single square: <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> = 1, <em>I</em> = 0, <em>B</em> = 4</span>, which satisfies the formula.</p></li>
<li><p>An arbitrary non-degenerate rectangle with sides parallel to coordinate axes: Assume <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> be the length of the sides of rectangle. Then, <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> = <em>a</em><em>b</em>, <em>I</em> = (<em>a</em> − 1)(<em>b</em> − 1),<em>B</em> = 2(<em>a</em> + <em>b</em>)</span>. On substituting, we see that formula is true.</p></li>
<li><p>A right angle with legs parallel to the axes: To prove this, note that any such triangle can be obtained by cutting off a rectangle by a diagonal. Denoting the number of integral points lying on diagonal by <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>, it can be shown that Pick's formula holds for this triangle regardless of <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>An arbitrary triangle: Note that any such triangle can be turned into a rectangle by attaching it to sides of right-angled triangles with legs parallel to the axes (you will not need more than 3 such triangles). From here, we can get correct formula for any triangle.</p></li>
<li><p>An arbitrary polygon: To prove this, triangulate it, ie, divide into triangles with integral coordinates. Further, it is possible to prove that Pick's theorem retains its validity when a polygon is added to a triangle. Thus, we have proven Pick's formula for arbitrary polygon.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="generalization-to-higher-dimensions">Generalization to higher dimensions</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, this simple and beautiful formula cannot be generalized to higher dimensions.</p>
<p>John Reeve demonstrated this by proposing a tetrahedron (<strong>Reeve tetrahedron</strong>) with following vertices in 1957:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display"><em>A</em> = (0, 0, 0),<em>B</em> = (1, 0, 0),<em>C</em> = (0, 1, 0),<em>D</em> = (1, 1, <em>k</em>),</span><br /></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span> can be any natural number. Then for any <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span>, the tetrahedron <span class="math inline"><em>A</em><em>B</em><em>C</em><em>D</em></span> does not contain integer point inside it and has only <span class="math inline">4</span> points on its borders, <span class="math inline"><em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>D</em></span>. Thus, the volume and surface area may vary in spite of unchanged number of points within and on boundary. Therefore, Pick's theorem doesn't allow generalizations.</p>
<p>However, higher dimensions still has a generalization using <strong>Ehrhart polynomials</strong> but they are quite complex and depends not only on points inside but also on the boundary of polytype.</p>
