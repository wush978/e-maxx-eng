<!--?title Edge connectivity / Vertex connectivity -->
<h1 id="edge-connectivity-vertex-connectivity">Edge connectivity / Vertex connectivity</h1>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>Given an undirected graph <span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span> with <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> vertices and <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> edges. Both the edge connectivity and the vertex connectivity are characteristics describing the graph.</p>
<h3 id="edge-connectivity">Edge connectivity</h3>
<p>The <strong>edge connectivity</strong> <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> of the graph <span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span> is the minimum number of edges that need to be deleted, such that the graph <span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span> gets disconnected.</p>
<p>For example an already disconnected graph has an edge connectivity of <span class="math inline">0</span>, a connected graph with at least one bridge has an edge connectivity of <span class="math inline">1</span>, and a connected graph with no bridges has an edge connectivity of at least <span class="math inline">2</span>.</p>
<p>We say that a set <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> of edges <strong>separates</strong> the vertices <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>, if, after removing all edges in <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> from the graph <span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span>, the vertices <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> end up in different connected components.</p>
<p>It is clear, that the edge connectivity of a graph is equal to the minimum size of such a set separating two vertices <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>, taken among all possible pairs <span class="math inline">(<em>s</em>, <em>t</em>)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="vertex-connectivity">Vertex connectivity</h3>
<p>The <strong>vertex connectivity</strong> <span class="math inline"><em>κ</em></span> of the graph <span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span> is the minimum number of vertices that need to be deleted, such that the graph <span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span> gets disconnected.</p>
<p>For example an already disconnected graph has the vertex connectivity <span class="math inline">0</span>, and a connected graph with an articulation point has the vertex connectivity <span class="math inline">1</span>. We define that a complete graph has the vertex connectivity <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span>. For all other graphs the vertex connectivity doesn't exceed <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 2</span>, because you can find a pair of vertices which are not connected by an edge, and remove all other <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 2</span> vertices.</p>
<p>We say that a set <span class="math inline"><em>T</em></span> of vertices <strong>separates</strong> the vertices <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>, if, after removing all vertices in <span class="math inline"><em>T</em></span> from the graph <span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span>, the vertices end up in different connected components.</p>
<p>It is clear, that the vertex connectivity of a graph is equal to the minimal size of such a set separating two vertices <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>, taken among all possible pairs <span class="math inline">(<em>s</em>, <em>t</em>)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>
<h3 id="the-whitney-inequalities">The Whitney inequalities</h3>
<p>The <strong>Whitney inequalities</strong> (1932) gives a relation between the edge connectivity <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span>, the vertex connectivity <span class="math inline"><em>κ</em></span> and the smallest degree of the vertices <span class="math inline"><em>δ</em></span>: <br /><span class="math display"><em>κ</em> ≤ <em>λ</em> ≤ <em>δ</em></span><br /></p>
<p>Intuitively if we have a set of edges of size <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span>, which make the graph disconnected, we can choose one of each end point, and create a set of vertices, that also disconnect the graph. And this set has size <span class="math inline">≤<em>λ</em></span>.</p>
<p>And if we pick the vertex and the minimal degree <span class="math inline"><em>δ</em></span>, and remove all edges connected to it, then we also end up with a disconnected graph. Therefore the second inequality <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em> ≤ <em>δ</em></span>.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note, that the Whitney inequalities cannot be improved: i.e. for any triple of numbers satisfying this inequality there exists at least one corresponding graph. One such graph can be constructed in the following way: The graph will consists of <span class="math inline">2(<em>δ</em> + 1)</span> vertices, the first <span class="math inline"><em>δ</em> + 1</span> vertices form a clique (all pairs of vertices are connected via an edge), and the second <span class="math inline"><em>δ</em> + 1</span> vertices form a second clique. In addition we connect the two cliques with <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> edges, such that it uses <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> different vertices in the first clique, and only <span class="math inline"><em>κ</em></span> vertices in the second clique. The resulting graph will have the three characteristics.</p>
<h3 id="the-ford-fulkerson-theorem">The Ford-Fulkerson theorem</h3>
<p>The <strong>Ford-Fulkerson theorem</strong> implies, that the biggest number of edge-disjoint paths connecting two vertices, is equal to the smallest number of edges separating these vertices.</p>
<h2 id="computing-the-values">Computing the values</h2>
<h3 id="edge-connectivity-using-maximum-flow">Edge connectivity using maximum flow</h3>
<p>This method is based on the Ford-Fulkerson theorem.</p>
<p>We iterate over all pairs of vertices <span class="math inline">(<em>s</em>, <em>t</em>)</span> and between each pair we find the largest number of disjoint paths between them. This value can be found using a maximum flow algorithm: we use <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> as the source, <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> as the sink, and assign each edge a capacity of <span class="math inline">1</span>. Then the maximum flow is the number of disjoint paths.</p>
<p>The complexity for the algorithm using <a href="./graph/edmonds_karp.html">Edmonds-Karp</a> is <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>V</em><sup>2</sup><em>V</em><em>E</em><sup>2</sup>)=<em>O</em>(<em>V</em><sup>3</sup><em>E</em><sup>2</sup>)</span>. But we should note, that this includes a hidden factor, since it is practically impossible to create a graph such that the maximum flow algorithm will be slow for all sources and sinks. Especially the algorithm will run pretty fast for random graphs.</p>
<h3 id="special-algorithm-for-edge-connectivity">Special algorithm for edge connectivity</h3>
<p>The task of finding the edge connectivity if equal to the task of finding the <strong>global minimum cut</strong>.</p>
<p>Special algorithms have been developed for this task. One of them is the Stoer-Wagner algorithm, which works in <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>V</em><sup>3</sup>)</span> or <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>V</em><em>E</em>)</span> time.</p>
<h3 id="vertex-connectivity-1">Vertex connectivity</h3>
<p>Again we iterate over all pairs of vertices <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>, and for each pair we find the minimum number of vertices that separates <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>.</p>
<p>By doing this, we can apply the same maximum flow approach as described in the previous sections.</p>
<p>We split each vertex <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> with <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> ≠ <em>s</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> ≠ <em>t</em></span> into two vertices <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>2</sub></span>. We connect these to vertices with a directed edge <span class="math inline">(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>x</em><sub>2</sub>)</span> with the capacity <span class="math inline">1</span>, and replace all edges <span class="math inline">(<em>u</em>, <em>v</em>)</span> by the two directed edges <span class="math inline">(<em>u</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>v</em><sub>1</sub>)</span> and <span class="math inline">(<em>v</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>u</em><sub>1</sub>)</span>, both with the capacity of 1. The by the construction the value of the maximum flow will be equal to the minimum number of vertices that are needed to separate <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>.</p>
<p>This approach has the same complexity as the flow approach for finding the edge connectivity.</p>
