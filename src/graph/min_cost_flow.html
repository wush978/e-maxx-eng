<!--?title Minimum-cost flow - Successive shortest path algorithm -->
<h1 id="minimum-cost-flow---successive-shortest-path-algorithm">Minimum-cost flow - Successive shortest path algorithm</h1>
<p>Given a network <span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span> consisting of <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> vertices and <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> edges. For each edge (generally speaking, oriented edges, but see below), the capacity (a non-negative integer) and the cost per unit of flow along this edge (some integer) are given. Also the source <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> and the sink <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> are marked.</p>
<p>For a given value <span class="math inline"><em>K</em></span>, we have to find a flow of this quantity, and among all flows of this quantity we have to choose the flow with the lowest cost. This task is called <strong>minimum-cost flow problem</strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes the task is given a little differently: you want to find the maximum flow, and among all maximal flows we want to find the one with the least cost. This is called the <strong>minimum-cost maximum-flow problem</strong>.</p>
<p>Both these problems can be solved effectively with the algorithm of sucessive shortest paths.</p>
<h2 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h2>
<p>This algorithm is very similar to the <a href="./graph/edmonds_karp.html">Edmonds-Karp</a> for computing the maximum flow.</p>
<h3 id="simplest-case">Simplest case</h3>
<p>First we only consider the simplest case, where the graph is oriented, and there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices (e.g. if <span class="math inline">(<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>)</span> is an edge in the graph, then <span class="math inline">(<em>j</em>, <em>i</em>)</span> cannot be part in it as well).</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline"><em>U</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub></span> be the capacity of an edge <span class="math inline">(<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>)</span> if this edge exists. And let <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub></span> be the cost per unit of flow along this edge <span class="math inline">(<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>)</span>. And finally let <span class="math inline"><em>F</em><sub><em>i</em>, <em>j</em></sub></span> be the flow along the edge <span class="math inline">(<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>)</span>. Initially all flow values are zero.</p>
<p>We <strong>modify</strong> the network as follows: for each edge <span class="math inline">(<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>)</span> we add the <strong>reverse edge</strong> <span class="math inline">(<em>j</em>, <em>i</em>)</span> to the network with the capacity <span class="math inline"><em>U</em><sub><em>j</em><em>i</em></sub> = 0</span> and the cost <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub><em>j</em><em>i</em></sub> = −<em>C</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub></span>. Since, according to our restrictions, the edge <span class="math inline">(<em>j</em>, <em>i</em>)</span> was not in the network before, we still have a network that is not a multigraph (graph with multiple edges). In addition we will always keep the condition <span class="math inline"><em>F</em><sub><em>j</em><em>i</em></sub> = −<em>F</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub></span> true during the steps of the algorithm.</p>
<p>We define the <strong>residual network</strong> for some fixed flow <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> as follow (just like in the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm): the residual network contains only unsaturated edges (i.e. edges in which <span class="math inline"><em>F</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub> &lt; <em>U</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub></span>), and the residual capacity of each such edge is <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub> = <em>U</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub> − <em>F</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub></span>.</p>
<p>Now we can talk about the <strong>algorithms</strong> to compute the minimum-cost flow. At each iteration of the algorithm we find the shortest path in the residual graph from <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> to <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>. In contrary to Edmonds-Karp we look for the shortest path in terms of the cost of the path, instead of the number of edges. If there doesn't exists a path anymore, then the algorithm terminates, and the stream <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> is the desired one. If a path was found, we increase the flow along it as much as possible (i.e. we find the minimal residual capacity <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span> of the path, and increase the flow by it, and reduce the back edges by the same amount). If at some point the flow reaches the value <span class="math inline"><em>K</em></span>, then we stop the algorithm (note that in the last iteration of the algorithm it is necessary to increase the flow by only such an amount so that the final flow value doesn't surpass <span class="math inline"><em>K</em></span>).</p>
<p>It is not difficult to see, that if we set <span class="math inline"><em>K</em></span> to infinity, then the algorithm will find the minimum-cost maximum-flow. So both variations of the problem can be solved by the same algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="undirected-graphs-multigraphs">Undirected graphs / multigraphs</h3>
<p>The case of an undirected graph or a multigraph doesn't differ conceptually from the algorithm above. The algorithm will also work on these graphs. However it becomes a little more difficult to implement it.</p>
<p>An <strong>undirected edge</strong> <span class="math inline">(<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>)</span> is actually the same as two oriented edges <span class="math inline">(<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>)</span> and <span class="math inline">(<em>j</em>, <em>i</em>)</span> with the same capacity and values. Since the above-described minimum-cost flow algorithm generates a back edge for each directed edge, so it splits the undirected edge into <span class="math inline">4</span> directed edges, and we actually get a <strong>multigraph</strong>.</p>
<p>How do we deal with <strong>multiple edges</strong>? First the flow for each of the multiple edges must be kept separately. Secondly, when searching for the shortest path, it is necessary to take into account that it is important which of the multiple edges is used in the path. Thus instead of the usual ancestor array we additionally must store the edge number from which we came from along with the ancestor. Thirdly, as the flow increases along a certain edge, it is necessary to reduce the flow along the back edge. Since we have multiple edges, we have to store the edge number for the reversed edge for each edge.</p>
<p>There are no other obstructions with undirected graphs or multigraphs.</p>
<h3 id="complexity">Complexity</h3>
<p>Analog to the analysis of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm we get the following estimation: <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em><em>m</em>)⋅<em>T</em>(<em>n</em>, <em>m</em>)</span>, where <span class="math inline"><em>T</em>(<em>n</em>, <em>m</em>)</span> is the time required to find the shortest path in a graph with <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> vertices and <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> edges</p>
<p>If this search is done with the <a href="./graph/dijkstra.html">Dijkstra algorithm</a>, then the complexity for the minimum-cost algorithm would become <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em><sup>3</sup><em>m</em>)</span>. However we deal with edges with negative cost. So Dijkstra is not applicable, at least not unmodified.</p>
<p>Instead we can use the <a href="./graph/bellman_ford.html">Bellman-Ford algorithm</a>. With it the complexity becomes <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em><sup>2</sup><em>m</em><sup>2</sup>)</span>.</p>
<p>Instead, we can also use the <a href="./graph/desopo_pape.html">D´Esopo-Pape algorithm</a>, which has a much worse complexity, but will run very quickly in practice (in about the same time as Dijkstra's algorithm).</p>
